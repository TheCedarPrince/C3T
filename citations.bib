Further, we hypothesized that momentarily deactivating this goal (via a switch in tasks) would prevent the activation level of the vigilance goal from ever habituating. We asked observers to perform a visual vigilance task while maintaining digits in-memory. When observers retrieved the digits at the end of the vigilance task, their vigilance performance steeply declined over time. However, when observers were asked to sporadically recollect the digits during the vigilance task, the vigilance decrement was averted. Our results present a direct challenge to the pervasive view that vigilance decrements are due to a depletion of attentional resources and provide a tractable mechanism to prevent this insidious phenomenon in everyday life.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Psychiatry lacks the objective clinical tests routinely used in other specializations. Novel computerized methods to characterize complex behaviors such as speech could be used to identify and predict psychiatric illness in individuals. AIMS: In this proof-of-principle study, our aim was to test automated speech analyses combined with Machine Learning to predict later psychosis onset in youths at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. METHODS: Thirty-four CHR youths (11 females) had baseline interviews and were assessed quarterly for up to 2.5 years; five transitioned to psychosis. Using automated analysis, transcripts of interviews were evaluated for semantic and syntactic features predicting later psychosis onset. Speech features were fed into a convex hull classification algorithm with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to assess their predictive value for psychosis outcome. The canonical correlation between the speech features and prodromal symptom ratings was computed. RESULTS: Derived speech features included a Latent Semantic Analysis measure of semantic coherence and two syntactic markers of speech complexity: maximum phrase length and use of determiners (e.g., which). These speech features predicted later psychosis development with 100\% accuracy, outperforming classification from clinical interviews. Speech features were significantly correlated with prodromal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the utility of automated speech analysis to measure subtle, clinically relevant mental state changes in emergent psychosis. Recent developments in computer science, including natural language processing, could provide the foundation for future development of objective clinical tests for psychiatry. npj Schizophrenia (2015) 1, Article number: 15030; doi:10.1038/npjschz.2015.30; published online 26 August 2015},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A propensity-weighted effectiveness analysis was conducted using 2 linked national databases with data from 30 US children’s hospitals from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012, on 3084 children with severe TBI. Clinical events including neurosurgical procedures were identified using validated computable phenotypes. Data analysis was conducted from September 1, 2016, to March 1, 2017. EXPOSURE Placement of an ICP monitor. Editorial page 942 Author Audio Interview Journal Club Slides and Supplemental content CME Quiz at jamanetwork.com/learning and CME Questions page 1023 MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A composite of hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, or survival with placement of new tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes. RESULTS Of the 3084 children in the study (1128 girls and 1956 boys; mean [SD] age, 7.03 [5.44] years), 1002 (32.4\%) underwent ICP monitoring, with substantial hospital variation (6\% to 50\% by hospital). Overall, 484 children (15.7\%) experienced the primary composite outcome. A propensity approach using matching weights generated good covariate balance between those who did and those who did not undergo ICP monitoring. Using a propensity-weighted logistic regression model clustered by hospital, no statistically significant difference was found in functional survival between monitored and unmonitored patients (odds ratio of poor outcome among those who underwent ICP monitoring, 1.31; 95\% CI, 0.99-1.74). In a prespecified secondary analysis, no difference in mortality was found (odds ratio, 1.16; 95\% CI, 0.89-1.50). Prespecified subgroup analyses of children younger and older than 2 years of age and among those with unintentional and inflicted (intentional) injuries also showed no difference in outcome with ICP monitoring. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE With the use of linked national data and validated computable phenotypes, no evidence was found of a benefit from ICP monitoring on functional survival of children with severe TBI. Intracranial pressure monitoring is a widely but inconsistently used technology with incompletely demonstrated effectiveness. A large prospective cohort study or randomized trial is needed.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite decades of research and interventions, significant health disparities persist. Seventeen years is the estimated time to translate scientific discoveries into public health action. This Narrative Review argues that the translation process could be accelerated if representative data were gathered and used in more innovative and efficient ways. Methods: The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities led a multiyear visioning process to identify research opportunities designed to frame the next decade of research and actions to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. ‘‘Big data’’ was identified as a research opportunity and experts collaborated on a systematic vision of how to use big data both to improve the granularity of information for place-based study and to efficiently translate health disparities research into improved population health. This Narrative Review is the result of that collaboration. Results: Big data could enhance the process of translating scientific findings into reduced health disparities by contributing information at fine spatial and temporal scales suited to interventions. In addition, big data could fill pressing needs for health care system, genomic, and social determinant data to understand mechanisms. Finally, big data could lead to appropriately personalized health care for demographic groups. Rich new resources, including social media, electronic health records, sensor information from digital devices, and crowd-sourced and citizen-collected data, have the potential to complement more traditional data from health surveys, administrative data, and investigator-initiated registries or cohorts. This Narrative Review argues for a renewed focus on translational research cycles to accomplish this continual assessment. Conclusion: The promise of big data extends from etiology research to the evaluation of large-scale interventions and offers the opportunity to accelerate translation of health disparities studies. This data-rich world for health disparities research, however, will require continual assessment for efficacy, ethical rigor, and potential algorithmic or system bias.},

  abstract = {Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate based on classes like race and gender. In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6\% for IJB-A and 86.2\% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7\%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8\%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a large group community-based behavioral smoking cessation intervention over an 8-year follow-up period and to determine precessation predictors of cessation at each follow-up time. Research Approach: Behavioral intervention followed by three longitudinal follow-up interviews. Setting: Regional Outpatient Cancer Centre. Study Participants: 971 participants in smoking cessation clinics held between 1986 and 1990. Intervention: Eight 90-minute sessions over 4 months utilizing education, self-monitoring, nicotine fading, a group quit date and behavioral modification techniques. Up to 110 smokers participated in each group program. Main Outcome Measures: Cessation rates at 3, 6, and 12 months postquit and at 8-year follow-up. Differences between successful and unsuccessful participants in precessation demographic, smoking history, and smoking behavior variables. Results: At 3 months postquit date, 39.3\% of the 971 participants reported that they were not smoking, decreasing to 32.1\% at 6 months and 26.0\% at 12 months. At the 8-year follow-up, 33.9\% of the original sample were contacted, and of those, 47.7\% reported that they were currently not smoking. There were nine predictors of cessation at the end of the program (3 months), which were similar to those previously reported in the literature. Similarly, at 6 and 12 months, six factors were associated with not smoking. At the 9-year follow-up the only variable predictive of continued abstinence was being female (p Ͻ .05). Conclusions: This program was successful in promoting smoking cessation and maintenance, even with its large-group format. Predictive factors were similar to those previously reported in the literature. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

A functional gesture is defined as the semantic meaning of an event that triggers a state transition and not as the movement to be performed. An interaction scenario has been designed in order to evaluate the features of the proposed model and to investigate how its application can enhance a post-WIMP human-environment interaction.},

Consolidation in some American industries, healthcare especially, has brought an increase in monopoly power in some product markets so that it is possible for firms to raise prices above what they would be in a freely competitive market. This, the authors argue, is a major cause of wage stagnation among working-class Americans and has played a substantial role in the increase in deaths of despair.

  abstract = {Background: While recent reports suggest that people with disabilities (PwDs) are likely to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and face multiple challenges, previous research has not examined if COVID-19 burdens are unequally distributed with respect to the disability characteristics of the U.S. population. Objective: This article presents the first national scale study of the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and disability characteristics in the U.S. The objective is to determine whether COVID-19 incidence is significantly greater in counties containing higher percentages of socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs, based on race, ethnicity, poverty status, age, and biological sex. Methods: This study integrates county-level data on confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering database with multiple disability variables from the 2018 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses are based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations that consider spatial clustering in the data. Results: Greater COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly associated with: (1) higher percentages of PwDs who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, below poverty, under 18 years of age, and female; and (2) lower percentages of PwDs who are non-Hispanic White, above poverty, aged 65 or more years, and male, after controlling for spatial clustering. Conclusions: Socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs are significantly overrepresented in counties with higher COVID-19 incidence compared to other PwDs. These findings represent an important starting point for more detailed investigation of the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on PwDs and highlight the urgent need for COVID-19 data collection systems to incorporate disability information.},

  abstract = {Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and fatalities worldwide. Outbreaks in U.S. nursing homes have persisted despite nationwide visitor restrictions beginning in mid-March. An early report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified staff members working in multiple nursing homes as a likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington to other skilled nursing facilities. The full extent of staff connections between nursing homes—and the role these connections serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection—is currently unknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility employment. We perform the first large-scale analysis of nursing home connections via shared staff and contractors using devicelevel geolocation data from 50 million smartphones, and find that 5.1 percent of smartphone users who visit a nursing home for at least one hour also visit another facility during our 11-week study period—even after visitor restrictions were imposed. We construct network measures of connectedness and estimate that nursing homes, on average, share connections with 7 other facilities. Controlling for demographic and other factors, a home’s staff-network connections and its centrality within the greater network strongly predict COVID-19 cases. Traditional federal regulatory metrics of nursing home quality are unimportant in predicting outbreaks, consistent with recent research. Multivariate regressions comparing demographically and geographically similar nursing homes suggest that 49 percent of COVID cases among nursing home residents are attributable to staff movement between facilities.},

  abstract = {The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases). The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema. All constraints are expressible in the same language. A database can be considered a structure in realization of the database language. The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping, the database schema. This describes how real-world entities are modeled in the database. "A database schema specifies, based on the database administrator's knowledge of possible applications, the facts that can enter the database, or those of interest to the possible end-users." The notion of a database schema plays the same role as the notion of theory in predicate calculus. A model of this "theory" closely corresponds to a database, which can be seen at any instant of time as a mathematical object. Thus a schema can contain formulas representing integrity constraints specifically for an application and the constraints specifically for a type of database, all expressed in the same database language. In a relational database, the schema defines the tables, fields, relationships, views, indexes, packages, procedures, functions, queues, triggers, types, sequences, materialized views, synonyms, database links, directories, XML schemas, and other elements. A database generally stores its schema in a data dictionary. Although a schema is defined in text database language, the term is often used to refer to a graphical depiction of the database structure. In other words, schema is the structure of the database that defines the objects in the database. In an Oracle Database system, the term "schema" has a slightly different connotation.},

There is also a less effective role of lymphocyte B and T in the humoral immunity due to the reduction of their proliferative response. The physiopathology of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) involves several modifications at the genetic and at the immune level, such as the increase of inflammatory cytokines and abnormal immune response in several levels.

The outbreak has since spread to every province of mainland China as well as 27 other countries and regions, with more than 70\hphantom{,}000 confirmed cases as of Feb 17, 2020.2 In response to this ongoing public health emergency, we developed an online interactive dashboard, hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, to visualise and track reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in real time.},

  abstract = {While advances in medical care have reduced mortality rates across the globe, perinatal mortality has decreased at a slower pace. This is particularly true of low- and middle-income countries, which contribute by far the largest proportion of perinatal deaths annually. Key reasons for this include lack of systematic screening, lack of early health advice-seeking and robust referral. To address these issues we are developing a scalable mHealth referral system embedded into an existing network of practising traditional birth attendants. Two off-theshelf sensors are bundled into the intervention, a 1D Doppler foetal heart monitor (cost \$35) and a pulse oximeter, to address key clinical perinatal complications: the detection of foetal distress and intrauterine growth restriction by automatic algorithmic analysis of the Doppler ultrasound signal. The devices directly interface with the smartphone for data transfer and to enable on-the-spot assessment. For the development of our system we partnered with a local healthcare NGO working in rural Guatemala, one of the poorest regions in Latin America. For the first time, the systemic barriers to maternal-child care posed by the acute lack of access to basic diagnostic technology, decision support, and reliable linkages between lay birth attendants and higher levels of care will be addressed. An initial usability study has been conducted to assess the feasibility of introducing the proposed system for use by frontline health care workers. The high rate of successful signal recordings and the positive feedback on system use and utility are encouraging indicators that, by bringing together engineers, physicians, public health workers, anthropologists, and local NGOs, we are developing an intuitive system capable in assisting practicing birth attendants to elevate the level of services they provide.},

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing timely and accurate information on the impact of the current pandemic on income and poverty to inform the targeting of resources to those most affected and assess the success of current efforts. We construct new measures of the income distribution and poverty with a lag of only a few weeks using high frequency data from the Basic Monthly Current Population Survey (CPS), which collects income information for a large, representative sample of U.S. families. Because the family income data for this project are rarely used, we validate this timely measure of income by comparing historical estimates that rely on these data to estimates from data on income and consumption that have been used much more broadly. Our results indicate that at the start of the pandemic, government policy effectively countered its effects on incomes, leading poverty to fall and low percentiles of income to rise across a range of demographic groups and geographies. Simulations that rely on the detailed CPS data and that closely match total government payments made show that the entire decline in poverty that we find can be accounted for by the rise in government assistance, including unemployment insurance benefits and the Economic Impact Payments. Our simulations further indicate that of those losing employment the vast majority received unemployment insurance, though this was less true early on in the pandemic and receipt was uneven across the states, with some states not reaching a large share of their out of work residents.},

Prognostic models can provide standardised risk assessment to guide clinical management and can be vital to reduce and prevent maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of prognostic models for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes developed and/or validated in LMIC. Methods\hspace{0.6em} A systematic search in four databases (PubMed/ Medline, EMBASE, Global Health Library and The Cochrane Library) was conducted from inception (1970) up to 2 May 2018. Risk of bias was assessed with the PROBAST tool and narratively summarised. Results\hspace{0.6em} 1741 articles were screened and 21 prognostic models identified. Seventeen models focused on maternal outcomes and four on perinatal outcomes, of which hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (n=9) and perinatal death including stillbirth (n=4) was most reported. Only one model was externally validated. Thirty different predictors were used to develop the models. Risk of bias varied across studies, with the item ‘quality of analysis’ performing the least. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Prognostic models can be easy to use, informative and low cost with great potential to improve maternal and neonatal health in LMIC settings. However, the number of prognostic models developed or validated in LMIC settings is low and mirrors the 10/90 gap in which only 10\% of resources are dedicated to 90\% of the global disease burden. External validation of existing models developed in both LMIC and high-­income countries instead of developing new models should be encouraged.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems all over the world are struggling to manage the massive increase in emergency department (ED) visits. This has put an enormous demand on medical professionals. Increased wait times in the ED increases the risk of infection transmission. In this work we present an open-source, low cost, off-body system to assist in the automatic triage of patients in the ED based on widely available hardware. The system initially focuses on two symptoms of the infection - fever and cyanosis. The use of visible and far-infrared cameras allows for rapid assessment at a 1m distance, thus reducing the load on medical staff and lowering the risk of spreading the infection within hospitals. Its utility can be extended to a general clinical setting in non-emergency times as well to reduce wait time, channel the time and effort of healthcare professionals to more critical tasks and also prioritize severe cases. Our system consists of a Raspberry Pi 4, a Google Coral USB accelerator, a Raspberry Pi Camera v2 and a FLIR Lepton 3.5 Radiometry Long-Wave Infrared Camera with an associated IO module. Algorithms running in real-time detect the presence and body parts of individual(s) in view, and segments out the forehead and lip regions using PoseNet. The temperature of the forehead-eye area is estimated from the infrared camera image and cyanosis is assessed from the image of the lips in the visible spectrum. In our preliminary experiments, an accuracy of 97\% was achieved for detecting fever and 77\% for the detection of cyanosis, with a sensitivity of 91\% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. Although preliminary results are promising, we note that the entire system needs to be optimized before use and assessed for efficacy. The use of low-cost instrumentation will not produce temperature readings and identification of cyanosis that is acceptable in many situations. For this reason, we are releasing the full code stack and system design to allow others to rapidly iterate and improve the system. This may be of particular benefit in low-resource settings, and low-to-middle income countries in particular, which are just beginning to be affected by COVID-19.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In the second experiment participants were randomly assigned to one of the conditions from the first experiment or to two further conditions, in which participants (spatial memory) performed a spatial match to sample task, or participants (verbal memory) performed a letter match to sample task. Vigilance performance post-interruption was best for rest, worst for continuous, and varied for the other interruption tasks. Overall, the results suggest the vigilance decrement is due to the repeated use of particular executive resources, but there may, in addition be domain specific interference when the primary task and activities during a break make use of the same resources.},

Although everyone had the same job profile, we found large differences in how individuals reported stress levels, with similarity from day to day within the same participant, but large differences across the participants. We examined two ways to address the individual differences to automatically recognize classes of stressful/non-stressful calls, namely modifying the loss function of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to adapt to the varying priors, and giving more importance to training samples from the most similar people in terms of their skin conductance lability. We tested the methods on 1500 calls and achieved an accuracy across participants of 78.03\% when trained and tested on different days from the same person, and of 73.41\% when trained and tested on different people using the proposed adaptations to SVMs.},

  abstract = {Background: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a network of health-related telephone surveys–conducted by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and participating US territories—that receive technical assistance from CDC. Data users often aggregate BRFSS state samples for national estimates without accounting for state-level sampling, a practice that could introduce bias because the weighted distributions of the state samples do not always adhere to national demographic distributions. Methods: This article examines six methods of reweighting, which are then compared with key health indicator estimates from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) based on 2013 data. Results: Compared to the usual stacking approach, all of the six new methods reduce the variance of weights and design effect at the national level, and some also reduce the estimated bias. This article also provides a comparison of the methods based on the variances induced by unequal weighting as well as the bias reduction induced by raking at the national level, and recommends a preferred method. Conclusions: The new method leads to weighted distributions that more accurately reproduce national demographic characteristics. While the empirical results for key estimates were limited to a few health indicators, they also suggest reduction in potential bias and mean squared error. To the extent that survey outcomes are associated with these demographic characteristics, matching the national distributions will reduce bias in estimates of these outcomes at the national level.},

The purpose of this study was to measure such complexity and also analyze its association with age. We modeled the dynamic reconfiguration process by dynamic functional connectivity, which was established by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and we measured complexity within the dynamic functional connectivity by sample entropy (SampEn). A brainwide map of SampEn in healthy subjects shows larger values in the caudate, the olfactory gyrus, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, and lower values in primary sensorimotor and visual areas. Association analysis in healthy subjects indicated that SampEn of the amygdala-cortical connectivity decreases with advancing age. Such age-related loss of SampEn, however, disappears in patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that SampEn of the dynamic functional connectivity is a promising indicator of normal aging.},

The causative agents, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are of zoonotic origin but may be transmitted to humans, causing severe and often fatal respiratory disease in their new host. The two coronaviruses are thought to encode an unusually large number of factors that allow them to thrive and replicate in the presence of efficient host defense mechanisms, especially the antiviral interferon system. Here, we review the recent progress in our understanding of the strategies that highly pathogenic coronaviruses employ to escape, dampen, or block the antiviral interferon response in human cells.},

Objective: To describe COVID-19 outcomes among people with IDD living in residential groups homes in the state of New York and the general population of New York State. Methods: Data for people with IDD are from a coalition of organizations providing over half of the residential services for the state of New York, and from the New York State Department of Health. Analysis describes COVID-19 case rates, case-fatality, and mortality among people with IDD living in residential group homes and New York State through May 28, 2020. Results: People with IDD living in residential group homes were at greater risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes: case rates e 7,841 per 100,000 for people with IDD compared to 1,910 for New York State; case-fatality e 15.0\% for people with IDD compared to 7.9\% for New York State; and mortality rate e 1,175 per 100,000 for people with IDD compared to 151 per 100,000 for New York State. Differences in cases and mortality rate were confirmed across regions of the state, but case-fatality rate was only higher for people with IDD in and around the New York City region. Conclusions: COVID-19 appears to present a greater risk to people with IDD, especially those living in congregate settings. A full understanding of the severity of this risk will not be possible until US states begin publicly sharing all relevant data they have on COVID-19 outcomes among this population.},

Therefore, we developed the R package JuliaConnectoR, available from the CRAN repository and GitHub (https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR), in particular for making advanced deep learning tools available. For maintainability and stability, we decided to base communication between R and Julia on TCP, using an optimized binary format for exchanging data. Our package also specifically contains features that allow for a convenient interactive use in R. This makes it easy to develop R extensions with Julia or to simply call functionality from Julia packages in R. Interacting with Julia objects and calling Julia functions becomes user-friendly, as Julia functions and variables are made directly available as objects in the R workspace. We illustrate the further features of our package with code examples, and also discuss advantages over the two alternative packages JuliaCall and XRJulia. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the package with a more extensive example for employing neural ordinary differential equations, a recent deep learning technique that has received much attention. This example also provides more general guidance for integrating deep learning techniques from Julia into R.},

We investigated the use of these devices to monitor human physiological changes during various activities and their role in managing health and diagnosing and analyzing disease. By recording over 250,000 daily measurements for up to 43 individuals, we found personalized circadian differences in physiological parameters, replicating previous physiological findings. Interestingly, we found striking changes in particular environments, such as airline flights (decreased peripheral capillary oxygen saturation [SpO2] and increased radiation exposure). These events are associated with physiological macro-phenotypes such as fatigue, providing a strong association between reduced pressure/oxygen and fatigue on high-altitude flights. Importantly, we combined biosensor information with frequent medical measurements and made two important observations: First, wearable devices were useful in identification of early signs of Lyme disease and inflammatory responses; we used this information to develop a personalized, activity-based normalization framework to identify abnormal physiological signals from longitudinal data for facile disease detection. Second, wearables distinguish physiological differences between insulin-sensitive and -resistant individuals. Overall, these results indicate that portable biosensors provide useful information for monitoring personal activities and physiology and are likely to play an important role in managing health and enabling affordable health care access to groups traditionally limited by socioeconomic class or remote geography.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite increasing recognition of the value of real-world data (RWD), consensus on the definition of RWD is lacking. Objectives: To review definitions publicly available for RWD to shed light on similarities and differences between them. Methods: A literature review and stakeholder interviews were used to compile data from eight groups of stakeholders. Data from documents and interviews were subjected to coding analysis. Definitions identified were classified into four categories: 1) data collected in a non-randomized controlled trial setting, 2) data collected in a non-interventional/ non-controlled setting, 3) data collected in a non-experimental setting, and 4) others (i.e., data that do not fit into the other three categories). The frequency of definitions identified per category was recorded. Results: Fifty-three documents and 20 interviews were assessed. Thirty-eight definitions were identified: 20 out of 38 definitions (53\%) were category 1 definitions, 9 (24\%) were category 2 definitions, 5 (13\%) were category 3 definitions, and 4 (11\%) were category 4 definitions. Differences were identified between, and within, definition categories.},

These mediators of the stress response promote adaptation in the aftermath of acute stress, but they also contribute to allostatic overload, the wear and tear on the body and brain that result from being “stressed out.” This conceptual framework has created a need to know how to improve the efficiency of the adaptive response to stressors while minimizing overactivity of the same systems, since such overactivity results in many of the common diseases of modern life. This framework has also helped to demystify the biology of stress by emphasizing the protective as well as the damaging effects of the body's attempts to cope with the challenges known as stressors.},

States and territories that issued mandatory stay-at-home orders experienced decreased population movement in most counties. The period after the first state relaxed a stay-at-home order was associated with increased population movement in states or territories that had not relaxed a stay-at-home order in the same period. What are the implications for public health practice? Stay-at-home orders can reduce activities associated with community spread of COVID-19, including population movement and close person-to-person contact outside the household. These findings can inform future public policies to reduce community spread of COVID-19.},

Here we model the effect of evictions on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, simulating viral transmission within and among households in a theoretical metropolitan area. We recreate a range of urban epidemic trajectories and project the course of the epidemic under two counterfactual scenarios, one in which a strict moratorium on evictions is in place and enforced, and another in which evictions are allowed to resume at baseline or increased rates. We find, across scenarios, that evictions lead to significant increases in infections. Applying our model to Philadelphia using locally-specific parameters shows that the increase is especially profound in models that consider realistically heterogenous cities in which both evictions and contacts occur more frequently in poorer neighborhoods. Our results provide a basis to assess eviction moratoria and show that policies to stem evictions are a warranted and important component of COVID-19 control.},

We call such structures "acsets," short for "attributed \$\textbackslash mathsf\{C\}\$-sets." Derived from previous work on algebraic databases, acsets are a joint generalization of graphs and data frames. They also encompass more elaborate graph-like objects such as wiring diagrams and Petri nets with rate constants. We develop the mathematical theory of acsets and then describe a generic implementation in the Julia programming language, which uses advanced language features to achieve performance comparable with specialized data structures.},

  abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents a comprehensive theory of causality which unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and offers simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book opens the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 2,800 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers’ questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interest to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

  abstract = {Background: In recent years response rates on telephone surveys have been declining. Rates for the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (BRFSS) have also declined, prompting the use of new methods of weighting and the inclusion of cell phone sampling frames. A number of scholars and researchers have conducted studies of the reliability and validity of the BRFSS estimates in the context of these changes. As the BRFSS makes changes in its methods of sampling and weighting, a review of reliability and validity studies of the BRFSS is needed. Methods: In order to assess the reliability and validity of prevalence estimates taken from the BRFSS, scholarship published from 2004–2011 dealing with tests of reliability and validity of BRFSS measures was compiled and presented by topics of health risk behavior. Assessments of the quality of each publication were undertaken using a categorical rubric. Higher rankings were achieved by authors who conducted reliability tests using repeated test/ retest measures, or who conducted tests using multiple samples. A similar rubric was used to rank validity assessments. Validity tests which compared the BRFSS to physical measures were ranked higher than those comparing the BRFSS to other self-reported data. Literature which undertook more sophisticated statistical comparisons was also ranked higher. Results: Overall findings indicated that BRFSS prevalence rates were comparable to other national surveys which rely on self-reports, although specific differences are noted for some categories of response. BRFSS prevalence rates were less similar to surveys which utilize physical measures in addition to self-reported data. There is very little research on reliability and validity for some health topics, but a great deal of information supporting the validity of the BRFSS data for others. Conclusions: Limitations of the examination of the BRFSS were due to question differences among surveys used as comparisons, as well as mode of data collection differences. As the BRFSS moves to incorporating cell phone data and changing weighting methods, a review of reliability and validity research indicated that past BRFSS landline only data were reliable and valid as measured against other surveys. New analyses and comparisons of BRFSS data which include the new methodologies and cell phone data will be needed to ascertain the impact of these changes on estimates in the future.},

  author = {Quigley, Jody and Rasmussen, Susan and Mcalaney, John},
  date = {2014-04-24},
  abstract = {Introduction: A systematic review of 86 papers revealed that adolescents’ suicidal and self-harming behaviour is positively associated with similar behaviours in people they know. Social norms research into other damaging health behaviours suggests that one’s engagement in a given behaviour is related to perceived social norms surrounding that behaviour, but social norms are often misperceived, such that it may be those misperceptions which are related to behaviour. Interventions which reduce such misperceptions have proven effective in reducing those behaviours. The current study aimed to address the dearth of research into the role of social norms regarding suicidal and self-harming behaviours. Method: 184 undergraduates completed an anonymous, online self-report survey exploring their engagement in, and approval of, suicidal and self-harming behaviours, and their perceptions of others’ engagement in (descriptive norms), and approval of (injunctive norms), those behaviours. Results: Consistent with previous social norms research, participants tended to overestimate the descriptive norms of suicidal and self-harming behaviours for less familiar groups (e.g. “students in general”) relative to their own. However, contrary to previous research, they also tended to underestimate descriptive norms for those closer to them (e.g. “your siblings”). No differences were found with regard to injunctive norms. Conclusions: Results suggest that The Social Norms Approach, which has been used in other areas to correct misperceptions and reduce target behaviours, may be applicable to suicidal and self-harming behaviours, but only in terms of descriptive norms. Further research is underway to explore the unexpected findings.}

Even though disease severity scores are not the key elements of treatment, they are however, an essential part of improvement in clinical decisions and in identifying patients with unexpected outcomes. Prediction models do face many challenges, but, proper application of these models helps in decision making at the right time and in decreasing hospital cost. In fact, they have become a necessary tool to describe ICU populations and to explain differences in mortality. However, it is also important to note that the choice of the severity score scale, index, or model should accurately match the event, setting or application; as mis-application, of such systems can lead to wastage of time, increased cost, unwarranted extrapolations and poor science.This article provides a brief overview of ICU severity scales (along with their predicted death/survival rate calculations) developed over the last 3 decades including several of them which has been revised accordingly.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

  abstract = {The Wilcoxon signed rank test is a frequently used nonparametric test for paired data (e.g., consisting of pre- and posttreatment measurements) based on independent units of analysis. This test cannot be used for paired comparisons arising from clustered data (e.g., if paired comparisons are available for each of two eyes of an individual). To incorporate clustering, a generalization of the randomization test formulation for the signed rank test is proposed, where the unit of randomization is at the cluster level (e.g., person), while the individual paired units of analysis are at the subunit within cluster level (e.g., eye within person). An adjusted variance estimate of the signed rank test statistic is then derived, which can be used for either balanced (same number of subunits per cluster) or unbalanced (different number of subunits per cluster) data, with an exchangeable correlation structure, with or without tied values. The resulting test statistic is shown to be asymptotically normal as the number of clusters becomes large, if the cluster size is bounded. Simulation studies are performed based on simulating correlated ranked data from a signed log-normal distribution. These studies indicate appropriate type I error for data sets with ≥20 clusters and a superior power profile compared with either the ordinary signed rank test based on the average cluster difference score or the multivariate signed rank test of Puri and Sen (1971, Nonparametric Methods in Multivariate Analysis, New York: John Wiley). Finally, the methods are illustrated with two data sets, (i) an ophthalmologic data set involving a comparison of electroretinogram (ERG) data in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients before and after undergoing an experimental surgical procedure, and (ii) a nutritional data set based on a randomized prospective study of nutritional supplements in RP patients where vitamin E intake outside of study capsules is compared before and after randomization to monitor compliance with nutritional protocols.},

In study 1, we examined the decrement in a visual line-length discrimination task employed in previous research. The task had a linear decrement in perceptual sensitivity with time-on-task based on the results of a trend analysis (orthogonal polynomial contrasts). In addition, the task had a profile of self-reported stress and workload similar to other moderately demanding vigilance tasks. In study 2, we examined the decrement in the same task with the factorial inclusion of rest breaks and goal switches late in the task. The inclusion of rest breaks resulted in a significant cubic trend in perceptual sensitivity. After the first rest break, there was a reversal of the linear downward decrement in perceptual sensitivity, but the second rest break did not elicit this change. The inclusion of goal switches did not cause any significant deviation from the linear trend and did not attenuate the decrement. In addition, the inclusion of rest breaks resulted in reduced self-reported effort and temporal demand. The results of the present study cohere with the expectations of a resource depletion account of the vigilance decrement.},

"A Christian should use these arts to the glory of God, not just as tracts, mind you, but as things of beauty to the praise of God." Many Christians, wary of creating graven images, have steered clear of artistic creativity. But the Bible offers a robust affirmation of the arts. The human impulse to create reflects our being created in the image of a creator God. Art and the Bible has been a foundational work for generations of Christians in the arts. In this book's classic essays, Francis Schaeffer first examines the scriptural record of the use of various art forms, and then establishes a Christian perspective on art. With clarity and vigor, Schaeffer explains why "the Christian is the one whose imagination should fly beyond the stars."},

  abstract = {Animals respond to stress by activating a wide array of behavioral and physiological responses that are collectively referred to as the stress response. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays a central role in the stress response by regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In response to stress, CRF initiates a cascade of events that culminate in the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. As a result of the great number of physiological and behavioral effects exerted by glucocorticoids, several mechanisms have evolved to control HPA axis activation and integrate the stress response. Glucocorticoid feedback inhibition plays a prominent role in regulating the magnitude and duration of glucocorticoid release. In addition to glucocorticoid feedback, the HPA axis is regulated at the level of the hypothalamus by a diverse group of afferent projections from limbic, mid-brain, and brain stem nuclei. The stress response is also mediated in part by brain stem noradrenergic neurons, sympathetic andrenornedullary circuits, and parasympathetic systems. In summary, the aim of this review is to discuss the role of the HPA axis in the integration of adaptive responses to stress. We also identify and briefly describe the major neuronal and endocrine systems that contribute to the regulation of the HPA axis and the maintenance of homeostasis in the face of aversive stimuli.},

Perinatal and maternal mortality is of particular concern with millions dying every year from potentially treatable conditions. Guatemala has one of the worst maternal mortality ratios, the highest incidence of intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), and one of the lowest gross national incomes per capita within Latin America. To address the lack of decision support in rural Guatemala, a smartphone-based system is proposed including peripheral sensors, such as a handheld Doppler for the identification of foetal compromise. Designed for use by illiterate birth attendants, the system uses pictograms, audio guidance, local and cloud processing, SMS alerts and voice calling. The initial prototype was evaluated on 22 women in highland Guatemala. Results were fed back into the refinement of the system, currently undergoing RCT evaluation.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite possibly higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), there has been limited reporting of COVID-19 trends for this population. Objective: To compare COVID-19 trends among people with and without IDD, overall and stratified by age. Methods: Data from the TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network platform was used to identify COVID-19 patients. Analysis focused on trends in comorbidities, number of cases, number of deaths, and casefatality rate among patients with and without IDD who had a positive diagnosis for COVID-19 through May 14, 2020. Results: People with IDD had higher prevalence of specific comorbidities associated with poorer COVID19 outcomes. Distinct age-related differences in COVID-19 trends were present among those with IDD, with a higher concentration of COVID-19 cases at younger ages. In addition, while the overall casefatality rate was similar for those with IDD (5.1\%) and without IDD (5.4\%), these rates differed by age: ages  17 e IDD 1.6\%, without IDD {$<$}0.01\%; ages 18e74 e IDD 4.5\%, without IDD 2.7\%; ages  75e IDD 21.1\%, without IDD, 20.7\%. Conclusions: Though of concern for all individuals, COVID-19 appears to present a greater risk to people with IDD, especially at younger ages. Future research should seek to document COVID-19 trends among people with IDD, with particular attention to age related trends.},

Here, I provide a brief tutorial of the ERP technique for consumers of such research and those considering the use of human electrophysiology in their own work. My discussion begins with the basics regarding what brain activity ERPs measure and why they are well suited to reveal critical aspects of perceptual processing, attentional selection, and cognition that are unobservable with behavioral methods alone. I then review a number of important methodological issues and often forgotten facts that should be considered when evaluating or planning ERP experiments.},

  abstract = {The growing trend for personalized medicine calls for more reliable implantable biosensors that are capable of continuously monitoring target analytes for extended periods (i.e., {$>$}30 d). While promising biosensors for various applications are constantly being developed in the laboratories across the world, many struggle to maintain reliable functionality in complex in vivo environments over time. In this review, we explore the impact of various biotic and abiotic failure modes on the reliability of implantable biosensors. We discuss various design considerations for the development of chronically reliable implantable biosensors with a specific focus on strategies to combat biofouling, which is a fundamental challenge for many implantable devices. Briefly, we introduce the process of the foreign body response and compare the in vitro and the in vivo performances of state-of-the-art implantable biosensors. We then discuss the latest development in material science to minimize and delay biofouling including the usage of various hydrophilic, biomimetic, drug-eluting, zwitterionic, and other smart polymer materials. We also explore a number of active anti-biofouling approaches including stimuli-responsive materials and mechanical actuation. Finally, we conclude this topical review with a discussion on future research opportunities towards more reliable implantable biosensors.},
